# API Calls
1. Have a look at the [source code](src/call_api.py)
2. You can run the code by running the following command:
    ```bash
   # cd into src if you're not already there
   cd src
   python call_api.py
    ```
3. This invokes a GET request to a simple, public API.
4. The example shows usage of the *requests* python library. You can read more about the requests library [here](https://realpython.com/python-requests/)
