# Python Dictionaries

1. Have a look at the [source code](src/dictionaries.py)
2. You can run the program as follows:
    ```bash
   # cd into src directory, if you're not already there
   cd src
   python dictionaries.py
   ```
3. Since most API calls return JSON, then this makes dictionaries very easy to map to API responses. Read the next section on invoking a simple [API](api.md).
